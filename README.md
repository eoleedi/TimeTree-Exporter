A Tool for Exporting TimeTree Calendar and Convert to iCal format(.ics) \
(The .ics file can then be imported into other calendar apps such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.)

## Usage

### Method 1: Pip

1. Install the package `pip3 install timetree-exporter`
2. Run `timetree-exporter`
   - Preferably, you can run `timetree-exporter -e <email>` to skip the input of email
   - and `timetree-exporter -o <output-file-path>.ics` to specify the output file path
3. Type in the email and password of your TimeTree account as prompted.
4. A timetree.ics file will be generated in the same directory, then you can import it to your calendar app.

### Method 2: Cloning the repository

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/eoleedi/TimeTree-exporter.git`
2. Change the directory to the project folder `cd TimeTree-exporter`
3. Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 -m timetree_exporter`
    - Preferably, you can run `python3 -m timetree_exporter -e <email>` to skip the input of email
    - and `python3 -m timetree_exporter -o <output-file-path>.ics` to specify the output file path

## Recommendation

You are recommended to import the ics file into a separate calendar (take google calendar as an example) as if anything goes wrong, you can just delete the calendar and reimport it.

## Requirements

- icalendar==5.0.12
- tzdata==2024.1
- requests==2.31.0

## Limitations

Alarms(Alerts) can't be imported to Google Calendar through iCal format due to Google's bug.
