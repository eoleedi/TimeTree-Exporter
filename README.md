# TimeTree Exporter
A Tool for Exporting TimeTree Calendar and Convert to iCal format(.ics) \
(The .ics file can then be imported into other calendar apps such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.)

# Usage
1. Download the timetree data manually and put it in the responses folder(see below)
2. Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python3 timetree_to_ical.py`
4. A timetree.ics file will be generated in the same directory, then you can import it to your calendar app.
## Advanced Usage
You can also specify the output file name by running `python3 timetree_to_ical.py -o <output_file_name>.ics`, or specify the input file / folder path name by running `python3 timetree_to_ical.py -i <input_file_name>.json`
## Recommendation
You are recommended to import the ics file into a separate calendar (take google calendar as an example) as if anything goes wrong, you can just delete the calendar and reimport it.
