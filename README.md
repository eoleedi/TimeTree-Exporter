# Advanced Usage
You can also specify the output file name by running `python3 -m timetree_exporter -o <output_file_name>.ics` or `timetree-exporter -o <output_file_name>.ics`

# Recommendation
You are recommended to import the ics file into a separate calendar (take google calendar as an example) as if anything goes wrong, you can just delete the calendar and reimport it.

# Requirements
icalendar==5.0.12

# Limitations
Currently, TimeTree data can only be downloaded manually through a web browser.
